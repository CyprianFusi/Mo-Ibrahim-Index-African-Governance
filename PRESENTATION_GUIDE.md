## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "Why do island nations perform so well?"
**A:** Three factors: (1) Manageable governance scale, (2) Economic specialization (tourism/services), (3) Political stability and strong institutions. Small populations enable more effective service delivery and democratic participation.

### Q: "Can countries really improve governance scores?"
**A:** Yes. Seychelles (+10.0), Gambia (+7.2), and Somalia (+6.8) demonstrate significant improvements are possible through sustained reform, political transition, and post-conflict recovery.

### Q: "What's causing declines in previously strong performers?"
**A:** Multiple factors: economic pressures (Mauritius -4.0), democratic backsliding (Tunisia -4.7), and complacency after years of strong performance (Botswana -3.6).

### Q: "Which category matters most?"
**A:** All categories correlate strongly with overall governance. However, Security & Rule of Law shows highest variation and often represents the foundation for other improvements.

### Q: "How does Africa compare to other continents?"
**A:** This analysis focuses on intra-African comparison. For global context, refer to Worldwide Governance Indicators (World Bank) or other cross-continental indices.

## Technical FAQ

### Q: "What's the scoring methodology?"
**A:** Scores are 0-100 (100=best), aggregated from 100+ underlying indicators across 4 categories and 16 subcategories. See Mo Ibrahim Foundation methodology documentation.

### Q: "How reliable is this data?"
**A:** IIAG is the most comprehensive African governance index, peer-reviewed and widely cited. Some data points are estimated where direct measurement unavailable (marked in source data).

### Q: "Can we filter by specific categories?"
**A:** Yes, in the interactive dashboard. Static charts show pre-selected views. Raw data available in `data/csv-files/` for custom analysis.

## Customization Tips

### For Specific Countries:
Filter interactive dashboard or create custom charts using:
```python
country_data = composite_scores[composite_scores['Country'] == 'YourCountry']
```

### For Specific Regions:
Use regional filter in dashboard or modify analysis script:
```python
region_data = composite_scores[composite_scores['Region'] == 'YourRegion']
```

### For Specific Time Periods:
Adjust year range in analysis:
```python
period_data = composite_scores[composite_scores['Year'].between(2018, 2023)]
```
